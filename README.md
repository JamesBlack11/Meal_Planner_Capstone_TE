We were tasked with the project of creating a meal plan that users can upload, edit, save, and delete recipes. from these recipes uers can create meal plans for their week with three slots for recipes per meal plan. The slots being breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I enjoyed the process of creating a full stack application starting with databases and ending with stylings in vue.
